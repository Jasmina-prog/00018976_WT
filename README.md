Book Review App

1. About the app

I created a simple web application "Book Review App" to manage a list of books and their reviews. This app allows users to view book details, toggle reviews, and perform basic CRUD operations (edit/delete books).

To create this Node.js and Express based app, I used EJS - Embeded Javascript engine template, Yup for validation, Bootstrap for styling, Mongo for database. My port is 3008 foe this app

Users can:

- View a list of books

- Add a new book

- Edit and delete books

- view review section with collapsible review sections

- Navigate through links in navbar and buttons


2. Instructions to run

- installing dependencies (npm install)

- starting MongoDB (mongodb)

- installing all other required packages shown dependecies list

- running the app (node index.js)

- visiting http://localhost:3008


3. App's dependecy list

This is the list of overall dependencies in my code

"dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^3.0.2",
    "body-parser": "^2.2.0",
    "cookie-parser": "^1.4.7",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",
    "ejs": "^3.1.10",
    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "method-override": "^3.0.0",
    "mongoose": "^8.13.1",
    "yup": "^1.6.1"
  },


4. I deployed the app in render (https://render.com)
[deployed version](https://zero0018976-wt.onrender.com)

But to make this app work, the page should be refreshed. More over, loading is taking some time when the link is followed, as I did not use premium version.
